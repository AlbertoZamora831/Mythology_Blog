                    <h2> What Mythology Meant </h2>
                    <p> Mythology is a way to explain how the universe was created and the law that the universe follows
                        or phenomenons that occur in the world. Also some myth have an explanation of the world ending
                        and brining a new generation of either gods, creatures, and humans, basically new life.</p>

                    <h2> Symbolism </h2>
                    <p> Mythologies bring many symbolism that artist, authors, politics, games, and more that can use
                        symbols in mythology to use in thair creation to give a deeper meaning, some information of
                        what's to come, or simething else.</p>

                    <p> Mythologies are also insparation for many other characters in comics, anime, mavies, books, and
                        other forms of media. Some examples are Goku from Dragon Ball Z, Ryuk from Death Note, the anime
                        Record of Ragnarok, Thor from Marvel, and other characters.</p>

                <h2>Did you know that ... </h2>
                <p> Some gods if not most of them usually act like humans for example some gods are petty, evious, get
                    angry, and other human traits. For example, in greek mythology most of the gods in the pantheon are
                    petty, some get wrathful and punish the humans if they disrespect them or a family like when Apollo
                    and Artemis killed the children of a mother when she disrespected the mother of the gods, their are
                    more stories about the gods punishing other humans because of their egos. So most gods are usually
                    seem human like with their personalities but with an enormous amount of power which increases their
                    egos, also like humans for we do get more prideful when we have some sort of power whether that be
                    money, political, or other. While this might include some gods or goddesses but not all of the gods,
                    some are not as prideful, or petty as other gods.</p>
