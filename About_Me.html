            <h1>Alberto Zamora</h1>
            <q>Good morning, my name is Alberto Zamora and I am 16 years old. I was born in California and currently
                living in Califronia with my family, while also attending high school. I like to play games at my
                free
                time from time to time, sometimes with my little brother. I am fascinated by technology/coding is
                because of how much you can make from coding, for example websites with different uses or
                explanation
                and also make games but that's another thing, also it seems fun.</q>

                <p> Some gods if not most of them usually act like humans for example some gods are petty, evious, get
                    angry, and other human traits. For example, in greek mythology most of the gods in the pantheon are
                    petty, some get wrathful and punish the humans if they disrespect them or a family like when Apollo
                    and Artemis killed the children of a mother when she disrespected the mother of the gods, their are
                    more stories about the gods punishing other humans because of their egos.</p>
