            <h1>Alberto Zamora</h1>
            <p>Good morning, my name is Alberto Zamora and I am 16 years old. I was born in California and currently
                living in Califronia with my family, while also attending high school. I like to play games at my
                free time from time to time, sometimes with my little brother. I am fascinated by technology/coding is
                because of how much you can make from coding, for example websites with different uses or explanation
                and also make games but that's another thing, also it seems fun.</p>

                    <h2> Game </h2>
                    <p> I enjoy playing games whenever I have free time, usually Roblox or Solitaire Spider, I also play
                        Roblox with my little brother sometimes as well. Some games I also play are Mario Kart,

                    <h2> Mythology </h2>
                    <p> I am interested in mythology because of how intresting the stories that people in the past
                        created about the universe and other mysterious accurrences that happen in the world that
                        couldn't be explain at the time. One example is how the gods or god created the universe and the
                        world with all its rules that govern it.</p>

                    <h2> Max </h2>
                    <p> My family and I have a dog named Max. Max was originally given to my little brother as a gift
                        from one of are cousins. He usually sleeps in my and my older brothers room at night mostly
                        because either one of us brings him upstairs so he doesn't eat out of the trash can also
                        sometimes he just goes upstairs to our room by himself. Doesn't like fireworks.</p>

                <h2>Did you know that ... </h2>
                <p> Some gods if not most of them usually act like humans for example some gods are petty, evious, get
                    angry, and other human traits. For example, in greek mythology most of the gods in the pantheon are
                    petty, some get wrathful and punish the humans if they disrespect them or a family like when Apollo
                    and Artemis killed the children of a mother when she disrespected the mother of the gods, their are
                    more stories about the gods punishing other humans because of their egos.</p>
